    "\n",
    "Data science is one of the most in-demand skills in the world today.  Harvard Business Review recently published an article with the title: [\"Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\"](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/).  This class will prepare you well to become a data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science involves the application of scientic methodologies to extract understanding from and make predictions based on data sets from a broad range of sources. Data science involves knowledge and skills from three areas: 1) computer science, 2) math/statistics and 3) domain specific expertise.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The objective of this summer is to teach the analytical mindset & programming skills relevant to data science. Students will learn the Python programming language, along with a set tools for data science in Python, including the Jupyter (IPython) Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, PySpark, and Tableau data visualization. Students will learn skills that cover the various phases of exploratory data analysis: importing data (web, JSON, CSV, relational data), cleaning and transforming data, algorithmic thinking, grouping and aggregation, visualization, time series, statistical modeling/prediction and communication of results. The course will utilize data from a wide range of sources and will culminate with a final project and presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one of the faster growing fields today, data science has new tools coming faster than publishers can create books.  To supplement the traditional readings on data science, we will be sharing state of the art tools and environments that are used by the best practitioners today: including matplotlib and Tableau for data visualization, Spark and PySpark for big data analytics.  We aim to equip you with the latest industry thinking & toolsets to become a productive data scientist."
