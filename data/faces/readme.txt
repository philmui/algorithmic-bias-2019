A database of facial expressions in younger, middle-aged, and older women and men

What is FACES?

FACES is a set of images of naturalistic faces of 171 young (n = 58), middle-aged (n = 56), and older (n = 57) women and men displaying each of six facial expressions: neutrality, sadness, disgust, fear, anger, and happiness.

The database comprises two sets of pictures per person and per facial expression (a vs. b set), resulting in a total of 2,052 images. A subset of 72 pictures is available without having to register in order to apply for a personal account. The database was developed between 2005 and 2007 by Natalie C. Ebner, Michaela Riediger, and Ulman Lindenberger at the Center for Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany.
